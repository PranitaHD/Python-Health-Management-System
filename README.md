Language :- Python Programming. In this program their are 3 Clients. At very first you will be asked either you want to "Log" or "Retrieve". Then for which client you want to "Log" or "Retrieve". After that, for specific Client you choose, you will be asked either you want to add Exercise or want to add Food. Then add data of particular option according to your choice.
